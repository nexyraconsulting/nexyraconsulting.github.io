| Layer | Recommendation | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client | **Phase 1:** ship this front end as a PWA. **Phase 2:** port to React Native (Expo) with the same screens and tokens | The current UI is React-based, so the port is mechanical. Native gives reliable push notifications and Maps intents |
| API | Node.js 20 LTS, TypeScript, Fastify or NestJS, Zod validation, OpenAPI generated from routes | Same language as the client; strong typing for money and time |
| ORM / migrations | Drizzle or Prisma, *or* plain SQL migrations (the supplied SQL is the source of truth) | |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15+ (managed: AWS RDS eu-west-2, Supabase London, Neon) | Exclusion constraints prevent double-booking at the database level |
| Jobs | BullMQ on Redis | 30-minute reminders, message sending and retries, trial-ending notices |
| Hosting | UK/EEA region (London) | UK GDPR, low latency |

## 2. Responsibilities

**Front end (client)**
- Rendering, navigation, form UX and inline validation (same rules as the API, for instant feedback)
- Live price calculation preview (`rate × duration × count − discount`)
- Optimistic UI, offline banner, queued writes when offline
- Building the Google Maps URL and handing off to the OS. No maps SDK is needed
- Never stores secrets. Holds the access token in memory and the refresh token in secure storage (native) or an httpOnly cookie (web)

**Backend (API) — the authority for every rule**
- Auth, sessions, verification codes, password reset
- Tenancy: every query is scoped to the instructor in the token
- Business rules: learner booking-readiness (§7), conflict detection (§27), discount ≤ value, pricing snapshot at booking time
- Totals are **recalculated on the server**. Client totals are display only
- Messaging: renders templates, includes bank details only when enabled, sends via the provider, records status
- Subscriptions: Stripe customer, trial, plan changes, cancellation, webhooks → `subscriptions` table
- Scheduled jobs: lesson reminders, `scheduled → completed` sweep, trial-ending and renewal notices
- Encryption of licence numbers and bank details

**Database**
- Integrity: foreign keys, CHECKs, the `bookings_no_overlap` exclusion constraint, generated totals
- Audit (`booking_events`) and history retention (learners are archived, never hard-deleted)

## 3. How the front end is built

`index.html` contains the whole application as one component:

- **Template.** Markup between `<x-dc>` tags, with `{{ path }}` holes, `<sc-if>` for conditions and `<sc-for>` for lists. All styling is inline and matches the brand tokens.
- **Logic class.** A `<script data-dc-script>` block containing `class Component extends DCLogic { … }`. It holds state, handlers, validation and the derived view model (`renderVals()`).
- **Runtime.** `js/nexdrive-runtime.js` mounts the template with React 18 (`js/vendor/`).

The page runs as-is. To change UI, edit the template. To change behaviour, edit the logic class. Keep the visual language in [brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md](../brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md).

Key areas inside the logic class:

| Area | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| Validation | `vPhone`, `vEmail`, `vPc` (postcode), `vLic` (DVLA licence), `regErr`, `detErr`, `lfErr`, `missing(learner)` |
| Learners | `openLearnerForm`, `saveLearner`, `deleteLearner` (archives, cancels future lessons, keeps history) |
| Booking | `openBooking`, `bfModel` (pricing, discount, sessions, conflicts), `pickSlot`, `review`, `confirmBooking`, `openEdit`, `saveEdit`, `cancelLesson` |
| Conflicts | `overlap(date, startMin, durMin, excludeIds)` |
| Messaging | `sendMsg`, `skipMsg` (preview built in the `message` sheet view model) |
| Onboarding | `obNext`, `finishOb` |
| Launch | `startSplash`, `skipSplash`, `launchOn` |

## 4. Connecting the front end to the API

All data currently lives in component state, seeded from `seedLearners()`, `seedBookings()`, `seedNotifs()` and `seedInst()`. `data/sample-data.json` has the same data in the API's shape.

Integration steps:

1. Add `js/api.js` exposing `api.get/post/patch/delete`, using `NEXDRIVE_CONFIG.apiBaseUrl`. It should attach `Authorization: Bearer <access>`, retry once after `/auth/refresh` on 401, and map error envelopes (api/api-documentation.md §2).
2. When `NEXDRIVE_CONFIG.mode === 'live'`, replace the seeds in `init()` with a load in `componentDidMount` from `GET /me`, `/learners`, `/bookings?from&to`, `/notifications`, `/subscription`.
3. Swap each state mutation for its endpoint, keeping the existing optimistic `setState` and rolling back on error:

| UI method | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| `obNext` (register / verify / details / plan) | `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/verify`, `PATCH /me`, `POST /subscription/trial` |
| `saveLearner` | `POST /learners` or `PATCH /learners/:id` |
| `deleteLearner` | `DELETE /learners/:id` (archives) |
| `review` → conflict check | `POST /bookings/check` |
| `confirmBooking` | `POST /bookings` (single, or package with `sessions[]`) |
| `saveEdit` | `PATCH /bookings/:id` |
| `cancelLesson` | `POST /bookings/:id/cancel` |
| `sendMsg` / preview | `POST /messages/preview`, `POST /messages` |
| Notifications | `GET /notifications`, `POST /notifications/read` |
| Subscription upgrade / cancel / resume | `POST /subscription/change-plan`, `/cancel`, `/resume` |
| Pricing, bank, preferences, profile | `PUT /me/rates`, `PUT /me/bank-account`, `PUT /me/notification-preferences`, `PATCH /me` |

4. Replace the fixed clock (`TODAY`, `NOW` at the top of the logic) with `new Date()` in `Europe/London`. Use a date library with time-zone support (Luxon or date-fns-tz) because of BST/GMT changes.
5. Lesson reminders: the server schedules the push. The in-app reminder card shows when `startsAt − now ≤ lesson_reminder_minutes`.

## 5. Local development

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, Docker, `psql`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env                       # fill local values; never commit .env
docker compose up -d                       # PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f database/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f database/seeds/001_subscription_plans.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v enc_key="$FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY" -f database/seeds/002_demo_data.sql
npx serve .                                # front end on :3000
```

Suggested API repository layout (separate repo, `nexdrive-api`):

```
src/
  app.ts               Fastify bootstrap, CORS, rate-limit, error handler
  config.ts            Zod-validated env (fails fast on missing vars)
  db/                  pool, query helpers, migrations runner
  modules/
    auth/ instructors/ learners/ bookings/ messages/
    notifications/ subscriptions/ webhooks/
  jobs/                reminder.ts, complete-lessons.ts, trial-ending.ts, send-message.ts
  lib/                 money.ts, time.ts (Europe/London), crypto.ts, maps.ts
test/                  vitest + testcontainers PostgreSQL
```

## 6. Testing

- **Unit:** pricing (`price = round(rate × minutes / 60)`, discount ≤ subtotal), validators (phone, postcode, DVLA licence, ADI, theory certificate), BST boundaries.
- **Integration:** overlap constraint (`23P01` → 409 `BOOKING_CONFLICT`), archive keeps bookings, tenancy isolation (instructor A can't read B).
- **E2E (Playwright):** the six workflows in the brief: onboarding, learner, booking, calendar, navigation, subscription. The demo panel in `index.html` lists their starting points.
- **Accessibility:** axe on every screen, keyboard focus ring visible, 44px touch targets.

## 7. Code conventions

- Money is always integer pence. Format only at the edge (`£80`, `£12.50`).
- Times are stored in UTC and shown in `Europe/London`. Dates go over the API as ISO 8601 with offset.
- Phones are stored as E.164 (`+447700900123`) and shown as `07700 900123`.
- Postcodes are stored upper-case with a single space.
- Copy is UK English, uses sentence case, and says what to do next ("Enter a full UK postcode, like SL1 3NY").

## 8. Replacing the runtime later

The runtime is a convenience for the design-to-dev handover. For the React Native or Vite rebuild, port each `<sc-if>` screen block to a component and move the logic class methods into hooks or stores (Zustand or Redux Toolkit). The view-model functions (`bfModel`, `bvm`) port almost unchanged.

## 9. Assumptions

- Subscription prices (Monthly £25, 12 months £240, 24 months £420, 36 months £540; term plans charged up front) are placeholders and include VAT.
- Terms renew for the same length at the end of each term unless cancelled. The trial is 14 days and needs a card, with nothing charged on the day.
- Lessons are 30–480 minutes in 15-minute steps. Slots are offered every 30 minutes from 08:00 to 19:00.
- A discount is a fixed GBP amount per booking or package, split evenly across a package's lessons.
- "Delete learner" archives the learner. Their future lessons are cancelled and past lessons are kept.
- Learner messages go by SMS by default, with WhatsApp and e-mail as options. Bank details are added only when enabled.
- ADI numbers are 6 digits. DVLA licence numbers are 16 characters. Theory certificate numbers are 8 digits.
- Navigation uses the Google Maps URL scheme (`https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=…`), so no API key is needed.

## 10. Referral programme & NexDrive Credit

Rules: [business-rules.md §3](business-rules.md#3-referral-programme). Flows: [user-flows.md](user-flows.md#referral-programme). Data: [database-schema.md](../database/database-schema.md#referral-programme). API: [api-documentation.md §5](../api/api-documentation.md#5-referral-programme).

### Front end (in `index.html`)

| Area | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Constants | `REF` (reward %, demo code), `REF_CODES` and `REF_USED_PHONES` (demo-only validation table), `RS` (status → badge), `REF_STEPS`, `refLink()`, `refReward()`, `genCode()` |
| Seeds | `seedReferrals()`, `seedCredit()`, which mirror `data/sample-data.json → referralProgramme` |
| Screens | `referrals` (Referral & Rewards), `referralQr` (Refer an instructor), `credit` (NexDrive Credit), sheet `referralDetail`, dashboard card (`hm.ref`), More row, subscription credit card, upgrade "Use NexDrive Credit" |
| Onboarding | `state.ref = { code, status, via }`, `checkRef()`, `v.rfo` (field), `v.obInvite` (QR/link banner), plan timeline `obSum.tl` |
| Deep link | `componentDidMount` reads `?ref=CODE` and calls `startRefOnboarding(code, 'link')` |
| QR | `js/vendor/qrcode-generator.js` (MIT, Kazuhiko Arase). `qrSvg()` renders on screen, and `qrPng()` draws a branded 720×900 PNG for save/share |
| Sharing | `share.whatsapp` → `wa.me/?text=`, `share.email` → `mailto:`, `copy()` → clipboard, `shareQr()` → Web Share API with files, falling back to url, then to download |
| Demo-only | `qualify(rid)` simulates the backend award. It is reachable only from the demo panel and the "Demo:" buttons (hidden when `showDemoPanel: false`) |

### Integration mapping

| UI action | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Load Referral & Rewards | `GET /referrals/summary`, `GET /referrals?cursor=` |
| Code, link, QR | `GET /referrals/code` (the QR is rendered on the client from `url`) |
| Apply code at registration | `POST /referrals/validate` (before the account exists, rate-limited), then `referralCode` in `POST /auth/register` |
| Referral detail | `GET /referrals/:id` |
| Credit screen | `GET /credit`, `GET /credit/transactions?type=&cursor=` |
| Auto-apply toggle | `PUT /credit/preferences { applyAutomatically }` |
| Upgrade with credit | `POST /subscription/quote { planCode, useCredit }` → show breakdown → `POST /subscription/change-plan { planCode, useCredit, quoteId }` |

The client must render `rewardPence`, `balancePence`, `amountPayablePence` exactly as the API returns them. Remove `REF_CODES`, `REF_USED_PHONES`, `refReward()` and `qualify()` when switching to `mode: 'live'`. They exist only so the demo works offline.

### Backend jobs

| Job | Trigger | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `referral-on-invoice-paid` | Stripe `invoice.paid` (first paid invoice of a referred subscription) | Set `payment_confirmed`, `qualifying_value_pence` = invoice total before credit, `reward_pence = round(value × pct / 100)`, `hold_until = paid_at + REFERRAL_HOLD_DAYS` |
| `referral-award` | Every 15 minutes: `status='payment_confirmed' AND hold_until < now()` with no fraud flag | In one transaction: lock the `credit_accounts` row (`FOR UPDATE`), recover `owed_pence` first, insert `referral_reward`, update the balance, set `awarded`, insert the notification, enqueue push |
| `referral-disqualify` | `customer.subscription.deleted` before payment, or `invoice.payment_failed` after final retry | `not_qualified` + reason |
| `referral-reverse` | `charge.refunded`, `charge.dispute.created` on the qualifying invoice | Post a `reversal` (clamp at £0, put the remainder in `owed_pence`), set `reversed`, notify |
| `credit-apply` | `invoice.upcoming` when `apply_credit_automatically`, or an explicit `useCredit` | Stripe customer-balance transaction or credit note, plus a `redemption` row in the same DB transaction (idempotency key = invoice id) |

## 11. Access: no admin gate

The demo admin PIN screen has been **removed**. `index.html` opens straight to the launch animation, then the dashboard (or the onboarding flow when opened with `?ref=CODE`). The `GATE` constant, the PBKDF2/SHA-256 helpers and the `gate*` methods were deleted from the logic class, and `adminLogin` is no longer a config key.

Instructor sign-up and log-in stay: they live in the onboarding flow (`obNext`, `finishOb`) and will be backed by `POST /auth/register` and `POST /auth/login` (api/api-documentation.md). If a staging build must be private, protect it at the host (see security.md), not in the page.

## 12. Product page (`product/`)

`product/index.html` is the public NexDrive landing page for the Nexyra Consulting site. Plain HTML + CSS + vanilla JS, no framework, no build step.

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `product/index.html` | All content: hero with live demo, toolkit (9 tools), refer & earn, pricing (4 plans), 14-day trial, FAQ, closing CTA, Nexyra footer |
| `product/css/product.css` | Self-hosted Hanken Grotesk (`../../fonts/`), Nexyra nav + footer rules, page layout |
| `product/js/product.js` | The main Nexyra site navigation, ported 1:1 from its Nav v2 component (menu overlay with 3-column drill-down, Products → NEXDrive / NEXHR / NEXTime, search, light/dark tone), FAQ accordion, live trial dates, app-link wiring |
| `product/js/search-index.js` · `search-engine.js` | The main site's search engine and index. Index URLs are absolute `https://nexyraconsulting.co.uk/*.html`, plus five NEXDrive entries pointing at this page |
| `product/img/` | Grayscale previews shown in the nav's Services / Work columns |

**Configuration**

- `<body data-app-url="../index.html">` is the single place that sets where every "Start free trial" CTA and the hero's live demo iframe point. In production set it to `https://app.nexdrive.co.uk/`. The `href`s in the markup carry the same default so links work without JS.
- Nexyra links are absolute to `https://nexyraconsulting.co.uk/` and use the live site's file names (`about.html`, `services-<name>.html`, `work.html`, `pricing.html`, `contact.html`, `privacy-policy.html` …). The live site has no clean-URL rewrites, so don't drop the `.html`. Change the `NX` constant in `product.js` and the footer `href`s if the domain differs.

**Navigation (same as the main site)**

- Top bar: the Nexyra Consulting pill (menu toggle + Nexyra logo, which expands to the full lockup when the menu is open) and the Search pill. There is no NEXDrive logo or product menu in the top bar.
- CSS is copied verbatim from the main site's Nav v2 (`product.css` → "Nexyra nav"); the JS mirrors its logic: section drill-down, service/industry previews, Products listing NEXDrive, NEXHR and NEXTime with their own page lists, 90 ms hover intent on products, Esc steps back, tone re-checked on scroll/resize and every 700 ms, `--nx-clear` (nav bottom + 30 px) for the hero's top padding.
- Products → NEXDrive links stay on this page (`#toolkit-heading` …) and "Open the NEXDrive app" uses `data-app-url`. NEXHR and NEXTime link to the main site.
- Breadcrumb: Products / NEXDrive (plain text, not links).
- If the main site's nav changes, update the `MENU` / `PRODUCTS` data in `product.js` and the nav block in `product.css` from `site/assets/components/Nav-v2-*.dc.html`.

**Live behaviour**

- Trial dates use the visitor's device clock: "Start today" label, reminder day (trial end − 3 days), trial end (today + 14 days), and the referral first-payment date (trial end + 1 calendar month). Refreshed every 60 s and on tab focus. Elements are marked `data-date="today|reminder|trialEnd|refFirstPay|year"`.
- Prices and referral rewards are static copy that must match business-rules.md S2 and §3: £25 · £20 · £17.50 · £15 per month; rewards £5 · £48 · £84 · £108 (20% of the plan total). Change both together.
- Pricing grid: 4 across at ≥ 1024px viewport, 2 × 2 from 560–1023px, stacked under 560px. Plan names, "Save" tags and button labels never wrap (`white-space: nowrap`).
- FAQ: one answer open at a time (first open on load), `aria-expanded` / `hidden` kept in sync.
- Nav: Esc closes search, then steps back through the menu levels. Desktop (≥ 1200px with hover) follows service links directly; touch / narrow screens drill into a preview first.

**Hosting**: the live demo iframe needs the app to allow framing by the product page's origin. See deployment.md → "Product page".
